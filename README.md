# 📚 Book Store Management System

A **full-stack MERN web application** designed to manage a bookstore’s inventory in a **digital, efficient, and user-friendly** way. This system provides complete **CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete)** functionality, enabling admins to easily manage a collection of books — including features for adding, viewing, updating, and deleting book records.  

Each book entry contains essential details such as **title, author, genre, and number of pages**. The project aims to simplify bookstore operations and replace manual inventory management with a modern, web-based solution.

## 🔄 How It Works

1. The **frontend** sends HTTP requests to the backend through RESTful APIs.  
2. The **backend** processes these requests (e.g., add, edit, delete, or fetch books).  
3. The **MongoDB database** stores and retrieves the requested book data.  
4. The updated data is sent back to the frontend and displayed to users in real time.
